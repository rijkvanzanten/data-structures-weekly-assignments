# Data Structures

Hey there! These are my attempts at / solutions for the assignments for the Data Structures class at the MS DV at Parsons. Each (weekly) assignment is structured into separate folders, each containing everything they need to run.

If you like what you see and like to know what problems these little projects try to solve, checkout the [class syllabus](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures).
