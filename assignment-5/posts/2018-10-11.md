# AR on the Web

I came across [this article](https://webkit.org/blog/8421/viewing-augmented-reality-assets-in-safari-for-ios/) explaining that it's now possible to embed rich Augmented Reality objects (in [Universal Scene Description format](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/Usdz-File-Format-Specification.html)) directly on websites. This gives designers and developers a completely new tool on their toolbelt to utilize on their websites.

These `usdz` files can be dynamically linked to using a regular anchor tag, with a special new `rel` attribute:

```html
<a href="model.usdz" rel="ar">Click me!</a>
```

Apple has made [a gallery of examples](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/gallery/) which you should definitely check out (assuming you have an iOS device üòÅ)!
