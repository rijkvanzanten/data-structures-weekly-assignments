## Description

The assignment folders for assignments 1 through 4 already contain most of the code we need. I already parsed and cleaned all the data from the start, so this weeks assignment was a little bit easier for me.

The only thing I had to do was to tweak the assignments slightly so they would save and retrieve data from a common folder, and make sure that they would parse the data for all ten zones instead of just zone 6.
