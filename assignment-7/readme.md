# Assignment 7

> For this assignment, you must have parsed/cleaned all ten zones. For these zones finish parsing and cleaning the rest of the data.

> See [the assignment details](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/assignments/weekly_assignment_07.md)

## Description

The assignment folders for assignments 1 through 4 already contain most of the code we need. I already parsed and cleaned all the data from the start, so this weeks assignment was a little bit easier for me.

The only thing I had to do was to tweak the assignments slightly so they would save and retrieve data from a common folder, and make sure that they would parse the data for all ten zones instead of just zone 6.

## Usage

You will have to run each part individually. Each folder will save it's output in the `data` folder which is then used by the following step as input. 

See each individual step for more information on how to run it.
